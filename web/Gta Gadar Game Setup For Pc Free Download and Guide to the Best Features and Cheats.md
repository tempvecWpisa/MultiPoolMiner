For example, if you installed GTA San Andreas in C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\GTA San Andreas, paste the folders there.
  
## Step 3: Run GTA Gadar.exe
  
The final step is to run GTA Gadar.exe, which is the executable file that launches the modded game. You can find this file in the "GTA GADAR" folder that you copied in the previous step. Double-click on it and wait for the game to load. You will see a new intro screen and menu with the GTA Gadar logo and theme.
