COMSOL Multiphysics is a software platform for modeling and simulating physics-based problems. It allows you to create, edit and run multiphysics models using a graphical user interface or a scripting language. You can also build and share applications based on your models using COMSOL Server or COMSOL Client.

COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2 is the latest version of the software, released in February 2016. It includes many new features and improvements, such as:
 
- A new Rotordynamics Module for analyzing vibrations and stability of rotating machinery.
- A new Ray Optics Module for modeling electromagnetic wave propagation with high-frequency and geometric approximations.
- A new Mixer Module for simulating fluid flow and chemical reactions in mixers and stirred reactors.
- Enhanced functionality for acoustics, heat transfer, electromagnetics, fluid flow, structural mechanics and more.
- Improved performance and usability of the graphical user interface, the Application Builder and the COMSOL Server.

COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2 is available for Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems. You can download it from the official website[^1^] [^2^] if you have an on-subscription COMSOL license or a software trial provided by your sales representative. You can also use it to connect to COMSOL Server from MATLAB if you have a COMSOL Server license with LiveLink for MATLAB[^2^].
 
COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2 is a powerful simulation software that can help you solve complex engineering and scientific problems. Whether you are a researcher, an engineer, a teacher or a student, you can benefit from the versatility and accuracy of COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2.

One of the main advantages of COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2 is its ability to couple different physics phenomena in a single model. For example, you can model the thermal stress in a turbine blade, the fluid flow and heat transfer in a pipe, the electromagnetic field and current distribution in a coil, or the acoustic pressure and structural vibration in a speaker. You can also combine different modeling approaches, such as finite element, boundary element, finite volume or ray tracing methods.
 
Another benefit of COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2 is its flexibility and customization options. You can create your own user-defined variables, functions, equations and boundary conditions to suit your specific needs. You can also use the Application Builder to create custom user interfaces for your models and applications. You can then deploy them to your colleagues or customers using COMSOL Server or COMSOL Client. You can also integrate your models and applications with external software, such as MATLAB, Excel, CAD tools or databases.
