The direction by Rajkumar Santoshi is flawless. The screenplay by K.K. Raina is tight and crisp. The dialogues by Santoshi and Dilip Shukla are hard-hitting and memorable. The performances by the entire cast are superb. Sunny Deol gives one of his best performances ever as Kashi, a man who stands up against injustice and oppression. He shows his versatility as an actor by portraying different shades of his character - from anger to love to pain to courage. Meenakshi Seshadri is charming and elegant as his love interest. She matches him in every scene with her expressions and dialogue delivery. Danny Denzongpa is terrific as Katya, the ruthless gangster who terrorizes the city. He makes you hate him with his evil deeds and wicked smile. Amrish Puri is brilliant as Kashi's father, who suffers from tuberculosis and tries to keep his son away from violence. Tinu Anand is hilarious as Kashi's friend, who provides comic relief in tense situations. The music by R.D. Burman is soulful and catchy. The songs are well picturized and add to the mood of the film. The action scenes are realistic and thrilling. The climax is mind-blowing and unforgettable.
