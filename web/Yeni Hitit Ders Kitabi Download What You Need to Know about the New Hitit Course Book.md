Each book has 12 units that cover different topics and situations. You should complete one unit at a time and review it before moving on to the next one.

The audio CD has dialogues and listening activities that improve your listening and speaking skills. You should listen to the audio CD as often as possible and repeat after the speakers.
- Thirdly, you should supplement your learning with other resources. Yeni Hitit Ders Kitabi is a great course for learning Turkish, but it is not enough by itself. You should also expose yourself to other sources of Turkish language, such as movies, songs, podcasts, websites, etc. You can also use online tools, such as dictionaries, grammar guides, flashcards, etc. to help you learn new words and rules.
- Finally, you should practice your Turkish with real people. The best way to learn a language is to use it in real situations. You can find a language partner or a tutor online or offline who can help you practice your Turkish. You can also join online communities or forums where you can chat with other Turkish learners or native speakers. You can also travel to Turkey or other countries where Turkish is spoken and immerse yourself in the culture and language.
