If you are looking for a textbook that combines the modern tools of organic chemistry with the concepts of biology, physiology, and medicine, you might want to check out *Introduction to Bioorganic Chemistry and Chemical Biology* by David Van Vranken and Gregory A. Weiss[^1^]. This book is the first of its kind to blend these disciplines and to focus on human cell biology and the combinatorial architecture of biooligomers (genes, DNA, RNA, proteins, glycans, lipids, and terpenes) as the molecular engine for life[^2^]. The book also uses rich illustrations and mechanistic arrow pushing to illuminate the central dogma of molecular biology[^1^].

The book is suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and molecular biology, as well as those going into medicine and pharmaceutical science[^1^]. It covers topics such as the chemical origins of biology, DNA, RNA, peptide and protein structure and function, glycobiology, polyketides and terpenes, and chemical control of signal transduction[^1^]. The book also features a problems-driven approach that challenges the readers to apply their knowledge and skills to real-world scenarios[^2^].
 
If you are interested in downloading this book in mobi format, you can find it online at various websites that offer free eBooks. However, you should be careful about the quality and legality of these sources. Alternatively, you can buy the eBook from Google Books for $144.00[^1^] or from other reputable online retailers.

Here are some more details about the book and its contents:
 
- Chapter 1: The Fundamentals of Chemical Biology. This chapter introduces the basic concepts and tools of chemical biology, such as molecular recognition, bioorthogonal chemistry, chemical probes, and bioconjugation. It also discusses the role of chemical biology in drug discovery and development.
- Chapter 2: The Chemical Origins of Biology. This chapter explores the origin of life from a chemical perspective, focusing on the prebiotic synthesis of organic molecules, the emergence of self-replicating systems, and the evolution of metabolism and genetic information.
- Chapter 3: DNA. This chapter covers the structure, function, and synthesis of DNA, as well as the mechanisms of DNA damage and repair. It also describes the techniques of DNA manipulation and analysis, such as PCR, cloning, sequencing, and hybridization.
- Chapter 4: RNA. This chapter covers the structure, function, and synthesis of RNA, as well as the processes of transcription and RNA splicing. It also describes the roles of various types of RNA molecules in gene regulation and protein synthesis, such as mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, miRNA, and siRNA.
- Chapter 5: Peptide and Protein Structure. This chapter covers the structure, function, and synthesis of peptides and proteins, as well as the methods of protein purification and characterization. It also discusses the principles of protein folding and stability, as well as the factors that affect protein structure and function.
- Chapter 6: Protein Function. This chapter covers the mechanisms and applications of protein function, such as enzyme catalysis, allosteric regulation, covalent modification, and protein-protein interactions. It also discusses the methods of protein engineering and design, such as directed evolution, rational design, and phage display.
- Chapter 7: Glycobiology. This chapter covers the structure, function, and synthesis of carbohydrates and glycoconjugates, such as monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids. It also discusses the roles of carbohydrates in cell recognition, signaling, infection, immunity, and disease.
- Chapter 8: Polyketides and Terpenes. This chapter covers the structure, function, and biosynthesis of polyketides and terpenes, which are two major classes of natural products with diverse biological activities. It also discusses the methods of natural product isolation and identification, as well as the strategies for natural product synthesis and modification.
- Chapter 9: Chemical Control of Signal Transduction. This chapter covers the principles and applications of signal transduction, which is the process by which cells communicate with each other and respond to external stimuli. It also discusses the molecular mechanisms and pharmacological modulation of various signaling pathways involved in cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation, and cancer.
